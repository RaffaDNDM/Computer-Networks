# BASE64 ENCRYPTION  & DECRYPTION
To compile the program you need to execute the makefile by typing:
'''make''' 
or
'''make base64'''
To erase executable file, you can type:
'''make clean'''
###How to use the program?
You can use the program by command line, specifying a filename or execute the program, typing the string during the exectution. The mandatory argument is either:
-d | decryption
---|
-e | encryption
---|
You can type only one of them in the same command line. If no filename is specified on the command line, the program waits for the insertion of the string, on a line during the execution. If you specify a file in the input, the result of the execution of the program will be in "output.txt"
