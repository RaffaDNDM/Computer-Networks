\chapter{Layer 3: }
The Internet protocol was the result of research job made by american Department of Defence (DoD). \textit{Internet} means Inter-networks communication and was designed for use of interconnected systems of packet-switched computer communication networks. The only things in common between the networks is the packet orientation.\\
The internet protocol provides for transmitting blocks of data called datagrams from sources to destinations, where sources and destinations are hosts identified by fixed length addresses.  The internet protocol also provides for fragmentation and reassembly of long datagrams, if necessary, for transmission through "small packet" networks.\\

Ping is the most known service of Layer 3 \cite{RFC791}.
