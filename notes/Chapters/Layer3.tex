\chapter{Internet Protocol}
The Internet protocol was the result of research job made by american Department of Defence (DoD). \textit{Internet} means Inter-networks communication and was designed for use of interconnected systems of packet-switched computer communication networks. The only things in common between the networks is the packet architecture.\\
Today the Internet Protocol is the only one yet used in Layer 3. The Internet Protocol provides transmission of blocks of data called datagrams, from sources to destinations, where sources and destinations are hosts identified by fixed length addresses.\\
The two main functions, that Internet Protocol needs to provide, are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Definition of unified addresses}}
\item{\textbf{Fragmentation}}
\end{enumerate}
Ping is the most known service of Layer 3 \cite{RFC791}.
